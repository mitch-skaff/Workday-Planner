# Workday-Planner

This is a simple, yet dynamic calendar application where a user can set appointments, save it to local storage, and have the information displayed regardless of exiting/refreshing the page. There is also functionality built in to color code the time blocks based on the time of day!

This application was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.js.
